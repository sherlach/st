# patching
patches were applied in # order

patch 11 wasn't working so I used an alternate version
patch 22-addonly only adds hb.c and hb.h and allows for 
manual patching of other files
patch 23-addonly only is the equiv for boxdraw
patch 23-ligature-compat is to make 22 and 23 play nice together

## still to apply
boxdraw (will require time and manual patching to work with ligatures)

## still to load
nil (open issue if you think something good hasn't been added yet)
