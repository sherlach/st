# patching
patches were applied to st 0.8.4 in ascending order, manually

patch 11 wasn't working so I used an alternate version
patch 22-addonly only adds hb.c and hb.h and allows for 
manual patching of other files
patch 23-addonly only is the equiv for boxdraw
patch 23-ligature-compat is to make 22 and 23 play nice together
